# Getting Started


There is no installation, you just need python interpreter to run the program.

python3 bulls_and_cows.py

No worries about bac_results.txt

The file is created during first app run in working directory. Game record is saved into this file for later analysis.
The last record is writen at the beginnig of the file.

# Bulls and Cows
The 2nd ENGETO PYTHON Academy project

The task was to create a program that would simulate the game Bulls and Cows.

The program includes:

Welcome user and possible display of game rules.

The program creates a secret 4-digit number (digits must be unique and must not begin with 0).


Enter players name. The name must fulfill the conditions (the length of min 3 alphabetical characters).

Enter the number of tries.

The player guesses the number.
The program will warn if entered a number shorter or longer than 4 numbers, if it contains duplicates or contains non-numeric characters.

The program evaluates the user's guess.
The program also lists the number of bulls / bulls (if the user guesses both the number and its location),
or cows / cows (if the user guesses only the number but not its location). The returned evaluation takes into account the singular
and plural in the output. So 1 bull and 2 bulls (same for cow / cows).

And so on..., till the end.
